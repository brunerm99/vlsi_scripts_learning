# VLSI Scripting
I'm using this to learn about VLSI design, testing, and verification and get better at scripting, especially in `perl`.

## File descriptions
* `bench-test.pl`
    * Parse `.bench` files to create netlist and solve for outputs given set of inputs.
    This could be used to verify a design's output.
